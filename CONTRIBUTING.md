# Contributing to QR Code Component

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the QR Code Component project! Contributions are highly appreciated and help make this project better for everyone. Below are guidelines on how you can contribute effectively.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

If you want to contribute to this project, start by forking the repository to your own GitLab account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

- Navigate to the repository: [QR Code Component Repository](https://gitlab.com/Yashi-Singh-9/qr-code-component.git)
- Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Once you have forked the repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qr-code-component.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitLab username.

### 3. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your changes. This helps keep your work organized and makes it easier to submit a pull request.

```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
```

Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the work you are doing (e.g., `improve-styling`, `fix-typo`, `add-new-feature`).

### 4. Make Your Changes

Make the necessary changes to the code, styles, or documentation. Be sure to test your changes thoroughly to ensure that they do not break existing functionality.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Once you have made your changes, commit them to your branch with a clear and concise commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of the changes"
```

### 6. Push to Your Fork

Push your changes to your forked repository on GitLab:

```bash
git push origin feature-name
```

### 7. Submit a Merge Request

Go to your forked repository on GitLab and submit a merge request (MR) to the original repository. Be sure to provide a detailed description of your changes and any relevant context. This helps the project maintainers understand the purpose of your MR.

## Code Style Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines to ensure consistency across the codebase:

- **HTML:** Use semantic HTML5 elements where appropriate.
- **CSS:** Use BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming conventions. Ensure your styles are responsive and test across different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript:** Follow modern ES6+ syntax and best practices if adding JavaScript functionality.
